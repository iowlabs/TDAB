# Tremor Detection Adquisition Board

This device consists of an acquisition board to read biometric signals from the human body, such as an EEG or EMG.

The board is based on the ADS2998 analog-digital converter developed for this type of applications. In addition, the developed board has the main feature of having 6 fully configurable analog signal conditioning channels.

Each channel can configure the gain as the cut-off frequencies of a band-pass filter formed by two independent filters, one high-pass and one low-pass. Each of these filters can configure its operating parameters by sending commands to the board.
